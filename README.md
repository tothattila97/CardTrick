# CardTrick

This mobile application is useful for magicians, who play with cards in front of the audience. Firstly, the magician chooses a card
from the list and shakes his own phone. A service runs in the background which use the built-in accelerometer to compute the actual 
acceleration at every moment. If the acceleration reaches a threshold value, the card will appear on the screen in a floating window
like chat heads. Finally, the magician drags the card on the screen towards the top right corner and the card will disappear, when
about seventy-five percent of the surface of the card is out of the screen. Meanwhile, the magician fastly pulls a real card from 
under the phone and entertains the audiance.
